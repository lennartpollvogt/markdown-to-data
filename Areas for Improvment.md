# Areas for Improvement:

1. Error Handling: More robust error handling and reporting could be implemented to deal with malformed markdown.

2. Documentation: While mentioned in the roadmap, comprehensive documentation is crucial for user adoption and maintenance.

3. Performance Optimization: For large documents, performance could potentially be improved, perhaps through more efficient algorithms or parallel processing.

4. Test Coverage: As mentioned in the roadmap, more extensive testing would improve reliability.

5. Edge Cases: Handling of complex nested structures and edge cases could potentially be improved.

6. Configurability: Adding options for users to customize parsing behavior could enhance flexibility.

7. Markdown Flavor Support: Explicitly supporting different markdown flavors and making this configurable could broaden the tool's applicability.

8. Output Formats: While JSON output is supported, adding support for other structured formats (e.g., YAML, XML) could increase utility.

9. Bi-directional Conversion: Adding capability to convert structured data back to markdown could be valuable.

10. Streaming Support: For very large documents, implementing streaming parsing could improve memory efficiency.


## Ideas: Async support

Adding an AsyncMarkdown class to allow for asynchronous operations could indeed be beneficial in certain scenarios. Let's explore the potential advantages and considerations:

Advantages of an AsyncMarkdown class:

1. Improved Performance for I/O-bound Operations:
   - If the markdown parsing involves reading from files or making network requests, async operations could significantly improve performance by allowing other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

2. Better Integration with Async Frameworks:
   - Many modern web frameworks (like FastAPI, Starlette, or aiohttp) are built around asynchronous programming. An AsyncMarkdown class would integrate more seamlessly with these frameworks.

3. Handling Large Documents:
   - For very large markdown documents, async processing could allow for better memory management and prevent blocking the main thread.

4. Parallel Processing:
   - Async capabilities could facilitate parallel processing of multiple markdown documents or sections, potentially speeding up bulk operations.

5. Real-time Applications:
   - In scenarios where markdown is being generated or modified in real-time (e.g., collaborative editing tools), async processing could provide more responsive user experiences.

6. Scalability:
   - For applications dealing with high volumes of markdown processing, async operations could lead to better resource utilization and scalability.

Considerations and Implementation Ideas:

1. Coroutine-based Methods:
   - Convert key methods to coroutines using async/await syntax.

2. Async File I/O:
   - Implement async file reading if the class deals with markdown files directly.

3. Chunked Processing:
   - For large documents, implement chunked processing to avoid loading the entire content into memory at once.

4. Async Context Manager:
   - Implement `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods for use in async context managers.

5. Compatibility:
   - Maintain a synchronous version for backwards compatibility and scenarios where async isn't needed.

Example structure:

```python
import aiofiles
from typing import List, Dict, Any

class AsyncMarkdown:
    def __init__(self, markdown: str = None, file_path: str = None):
        self.markdown = markdown
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.markdown_list = []

    async def load_from_file(self):
        if self.file_path:
            async with aiofiles.open(self.file_path, mode='r') as file:
                self.markdown = await file.read()

    async def process(self):
        if not self.markdown:
            await self.load_from_file()
        # Implement async versions of your processing logic here
        # You might want to break this into smaller async methods

    async def get_md_building_blocks(self, blocks: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        # Async implementation of get_md_building_blocks

    async def __aenter__(self):
        await self.load_from_file()
        return self

    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
        # Cleanup operations if needed
        pass

# Usage example
async with AsyncMarkdown(file_path='large_document.md') as md:
    await md.process()
    result = await md.get_md_building_blocks(['table', 'list'])
```

While adding async capabilities could be beneficial, it's important to consider:

1. Complexity: Async code can be more complex to write and maintain.
2. Use Case: Ensure that the typical use cases for your library would actually benefit from async operations.
3. Learning Curve: It may increase the learning curve for users not familiar with async programming.
